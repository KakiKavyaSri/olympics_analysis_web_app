🏅 **Olympics Data Analysis Web Application**

This **Olympics Data Analysis** web application is designed to offer a comprehensive exploration of Olympics data, with features divided into four main sections: **Medal Tally**, **Overall Analysis**, **Country-wise Analysis**, and **Athlete Analysis**.

**Medal Tally:** Provides a ranked overview of medals from the start of the Olympics to the present. Users can filter by specific years and countries to gain insights into rankings and performances based on the selected criteria.
  
**Overall Analysis:** Offers a graphical overview of participation trends over the years, including the number of events in each sport, the most successful athletes, and general participation data. Heatmaps are included to illustrate event counts over time.
  
**Country-wise Analysis:** Delivers detailed heatmaps and ranking information for specific countries, allowing users to explore how each country performed in different years. The analysis includes country-specific performance metrics and rankings.
  
**Athlete Analysis:** Focuses on individual athlete performances, providing data based on year, gender, and medals won (Gold, Silver, Bronze). Additionally, users can compare the participation of men and women over time.

The application is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend and deployment, with **Python** and **Pandas** for data handling. For visualization, the project utilizes **Seaborn** and **Plotly**, ensuring robust and interactive plots.
